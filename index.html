            Hello! My name is Joel Schott, and I will be going to Svishtov, Bulgaria from May 17th through July 1st on a missions trip with the <a href="https://iminc.org/go/student-missions/college-missions-program/">IM College Missions Program</a>. I will be going with a group of seven other college students from across the United States, and we will be working with <a href="https://iminc.org/im-missionaries/tim-and-lydia-awtrey/">Tim and Lydia Awtrey</a>, who are full-time missionaries with IM in Svishtov. I will be helping with the youth group at the Free Will Baptist church, pursuing opportunities for discipleship and evangelism. For one week during my time there, I will be a part of a cultural exchange program with the high school in Svishtov, where I will be paired with a local high school student and will get to learn about Bulgarian culture and share about myself and American culture.

            Your prayers are extremely important for this trip to be impactful for me and for those I will be ministering to. Please keep this trip in your prayers, praying for wisdom, boldness, and opportunities for sharing the gospel. This website has a prayer calendar further down, and the email newsletter will also have more specific prayer requests.

            Prayer Calendar
        </h3>
        <ul style="max-width: 800px; text-align: justify; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
            <li>April 14 - April 20: Pray for me and other missionaries to be diligent in our spiritual disciplines, especially our study of Scripture, that we would be saturated in the truth we hope to share and equipped for every good work. Pray for prayer - that we would pray with perseverance and confidence, fasting from the things that distract us.</li>
            <li>April 21 - April 27: Pray for unity in our mission team. We have diverse backgrounds and experiences, but are united in one faith and purpose and will mutually support and complement one another. Pray that we would have the humility and grace to encourage, strengthen, and sharpen one another.</li>
            <li>April 28 - May 4: Pray for God to work to prepare opportunities for relationships to be built and the gospel to be shared. Crossing language and cultural barriers will be difficult, so pray for us and other missionaries to be humble learners, using seemingly ordinary means and activities to reach others.</li>
            <li>May 5 - May 11: Pray for the church in Svishtov and other faithful churches across Bulgaria, especially for wise leaders to be raised up and for missionaries to persevere through difficult times. Most Bulgarians are nominally Orthodox, so many consider themselves to be Christian despite not having a relationship with Jesus. Pray for the faithful Bulgarian churches to be lights pointing to the truth and a saving relationship with Jesus.</li>
            <li>May 12 - May 18: Pray for safety, comfort, and perspective as we leave for a new country, culture, and language. Pray for us all to trust our soverign God who works all things for good and to be grateful and eager to serve others in Bulgaria. Pray for us to adjust and build connections quickly.</li>
        </ul>
