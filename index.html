            Hello! My name is Joel Schott, and I will be going to Svishtov, Bulgaria from May 17th through July 1st on a missions trip with the <a href="https://iminc.org/go/student-missions/college-missions-program/">IM College Missions Program</a>. I will be going with a group of seven other college students from across the United States, and we will be working with <a href="https://iminc.org/im-missionaries/tim-and-lydia-awtrey/">Tim and Lydia Awtrey</a>, who are full-time missionaries with IM in Svishtov. I will be helping with the youth group at the Free Will Baptist church, pursuing opportunities for discipleship and evangelism. For one week during my time there, I will be a part of a cultural exchange program with the high school in Svishtov, where I will be paired with a local high school student and will get to learn about Bulgarian culture and share about myself and American culture.

            Your prayers are extremely important for this trip to be impactful for me and for those I will be ministering to. Please keep this trip in your prayers, praying for wisdom, boldness, and opportunities for sharing the gospel. This website has a prayer calendar further down, and the email newsletter will also have more specific prayer requests.

            <li>May 14 - May 20: Pray for me and other missionaries to be diligent in our spiritual disciplines, especially our study of Scripture, that we would be saturated in the truth we hope to share and equipped for every good work. Pray for prayer - that we would pray with perseverance and confidence, at all times and in all places, fasting from the things that distract us.</li>
